# trinhPortfolio

##Description 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was done as the our first challenge to be performed from scratch. The overall goal of this challenge was to incorporate CSS as well as HTML in order to create a more formatted webpage than a blank page of text using just HTML. The current page is still a work-in-progress as there are still more projects to be done before I can complete the portfolio. Along with this, the CSS stylings will also need to be worked on in the future as I have not yet been able to use CSS to its fullets extent.

##Usage 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The webpage can be accessed via [https://tomygoi.github.io/trinhPortfolio/]. The navigation buttons at the center-top of the webpage will redirect to the corresponding sections of the page.
