        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Tony Trinh and I am a student at the University of Georgia! I am attending this boot camp to broaden my experience in computer science and eventually seek a work in this field. I previously studied computer science throughout high school, but did not take the opportunity at the time to continue. Through this bootcamp I hope to further develop the skills I was previously introduced to. So far, we have been able to use the knowledge provided to us to refactor existing code which will be linked below.
